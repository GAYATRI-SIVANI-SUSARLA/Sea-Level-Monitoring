This web application provides an interactive platform for visualizing and comparing sea level trends from multiple tide gauge stations worldwide. The application fetches real-time data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) and automatically calculates trends, enabling users to analyze climate change impacts on coastal regions.
